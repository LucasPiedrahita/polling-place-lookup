# polling-place-lookup
See the live app at https://lucaspiedrahita.github.io/polling-place-lookup/

This is an mobile-first application the Wake County Residents can use to identify their assigned polling place.

When a user enters their address, the application matches the input to an address point, performs a spatial selection to get the polling place jurisdiction for that point,  zooms the map to show the address and polling place, and displays the polling place information and driving directions.
